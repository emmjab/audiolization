      <h1>GSAF report reveals gender gap also a problem in shark maulings</h1>
      <p>Earlier this week, the Global Shark Attack File released its annual findings of every single brutal shark mauling since 1914 — likely in the spirit of festivity for Discovery’s beloved Shark Week.</p>
      <p>Unlike previous years, however, GSAF realized a disturbing trend. For every man sharks eat, they attack a measly .11 woman — a phenomenon experts are calling, “Like, a weird, twice-removed cousin of the wage gap.”</p>
      <p>“Why are sharks still discriminating?” marine biologist Katie Current said. “Don’t they know gender is a protected class? The report honestly brought up more questions than answers.”</p>
      <p>Among the mysteries with which experts must contend are the strange patterns in shark-related violence that vary by decade.</p>
      <p>With a strange blip in data that can only be attributed to 1967’s summer of love, the late ‘60s enjoyed a noticeable lull in maulings, with annual global attacks dropping “hecka percent,” according to mathematician Algae Bra, who’s been watching Shark Week every year since like, 2003.</p>
      <p>The sharpest uptick in shark attack data, however, has occurred in the past 15 years.</p>
      <p>“Back in the good old days of 1915, there were merely six annual shark attacks worldwide — compared to 116 after the advent of the internet, the rise of millennials and other important factors,” Current said.</p>
      <p>CORRECTION: A previous version of this story attempted to make a really bad pun about surfing the waves of feminism that the author has since given up on. The story has been modified to reflect these changes.</p>
